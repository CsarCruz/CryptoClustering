# CryptoClustering

In this project, the goal is to utilize Python and unsupervised machine learning techniques to predict the impact of 24-hour and 7-day price changes on cryptocurrencies. The project focuses on exploring and analyzing cryptocurrency market data to uncover patterns and trends that may affect the price fluctuations.

The project requires a solid understanding of Python programming and its data manipulation capabilities.

The next crucial component is unsupervised learning. Unsupervised learning does not rely on labeled data. Instead, it aims to identify hidden structures and patterns within the data itself. In this context, unsupervised learning techniques such as clustering and dimensionality reduction will play a pivotal role in identifying groups of cryptocurrencies that exhibit similar price change behavior.
